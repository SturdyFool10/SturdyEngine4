Updates & License Policy

## Key Terms and Definitions
- **Project**: Depending on context either refers to the Engine which is licensed under this license, or the product being made with it. **“your project”** means the latter, **“the project”** means the former.
- **Code**: The text that gets compiled to make the project work.
- **Codebase**: The body of code comprising the engine project.
- **Newer Version Code**: Any code (including files, fragments, patches, commits, or merged changes) originating from a version released after the version you originally obtained.

## 1. License per version
Each released version of this software is licensed under the license distributed with that version (the **“Version License”**). Portions of the code which have changed with that version are also licensed under the Version License from its respective version, meaning the version where that code was changed last.

---

## 2. No automatic relicensing of prior versions
If you received a version under a prior Version License, that prior Version License continues to govern your rights to that version.

**Old versions remain under their accepted license** and will not retroactively change **so long as**:
- they remain unmodified; or
- they were modified **without influence from Newer Version Code** (i.e., the modifications were independently created and do not incorporate, adapt, derive from, or copy Newer Version Code).

Nothing in this policy changes the license of any previously released version you already received except as described in Sections 3 and 4.

---

## 3. Acceptance required for Newer Version Code (even without updating)
If you **download, install, use, copy, merge, cherry-pick, backport, incorporate, or otherwise make use of any Newer Version Code**, then you agree that:
- that Newer Version Code is governed by the Version License included with the newer version it came from; and
- **you must accept that Version License** even if you do **not** otherwise “update” your full installation or repository to that newer version.

This applies whether Newer Version Code is obtained from official distributions, source archives, update feeds, repositories, mirrors, patches, pull requests, code snippets, or any other source.

---

## 4. Acceptance required for new versions distributed by us
By downloading, installing, or using any newer version distributed by the copyright holder, or portions of the code of any newer versions of this project, you agree that the newer version (and any Newer Version Code) is governed by the Version License included with that newer version.

---

## 5. Optional: updates channel gating
The copyright holder may require acceptance of any Licenses for a newer version as a condition of access to that newer version (including binaries, source distributions, or update feeds) distributed by the copyright holder.

---

## 6. Downstream distributors
Downstream distributors may distribute versions they received under the applicable Version License for that version. They are not required to enforce this policy.

---

## IN SUMMARY
You are bound by the current Version License for the version you received, and it cannot change out from under your project.

Older versions that remain unmodified—or are modified independently without influence from Newer Version Code—remain licensed under the Version License you already accepted and **do not** retroactively change.

However, if you use any Newer Version Code (even “just a file” or “just a patch”) you must accept the Version License for the newer version that code came from, and you can become bound by that newer license by updating to the new version **or** by incorporating any Newer Version Code into an older codebase.
