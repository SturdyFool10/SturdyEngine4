# Contributor License Agreement (Clickthrough)

By checking the “I agree” box in a pull request (or otherwise submitting a Contribution), you confirm that you have read, understand, and agree to this Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”).

This Agreement is between **you** (“Contributor”) and the **Project maintainer(s)/owner(s)** (“Maintainer”) for contributions to **[PROJECT NAME]** (the “Project”).

If you do not agree to this Agreement, do not submit Contributions.

## 1. Definitions

**“Contribution”** means any work of authorship that you intentionally submit for inclusion in, or improvement of, the Project. This includes source code, object code, documentation, tests, designs, comments, and any other material.

**“Submit”** means sending a Contribution to the Project in any way, including pull requests, commits, patches, code review suggestions, issue attachments, or email, unless you clearly mark the submission “NOT A CONTRIBUTION.”

**“Project Materials”** means the Project, its codebase, documentation, build artifacts, releases, and any derivative works or transformations thereof.

**“Organization”** means any company, non-profit, institution, or other legal entity on whose behalf you are acting, including your employer if applicable.

---

## 2. Integration & Transformations

You understand and agree that any accepted Contribution may be merged into the Project and become part of the Project Materials. The Maintainer may modify, refactor, reformat, translate, split, combine, or otherwise transform your Contribution now or in the future.

The Maintainer is not required to accept any Contribution and may reject, remove, or revert Contributions at any time.

---

## 3. Copyright License Grant

You grant the Maintainer a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable** copyright license to:

- use, reproduce, modify, adapt, refactor, transform, translate, and create derivative works of your Contribution;
- display, perform, distribute, and make available your Contribution and derivative works; and
- **sublicense, relicense, and otherwise authorize third parties** to do any of the above **under any license terms the Maintainer chooses**, including open-source, source-available, proprietary, commercial, or dual-license terms, and including future license changes.

This grant applies regardless of how the Project Materials evolve and survives any termination of your relationship with the Project or Maintainer.

## 4. Patent License Grant

To the extent you have the right to grant it, you grant the Maintainer and recipients of the Project Materials a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable** patent license under any patent claims you control that are necessarily infringed by:

- your Contribution alone; or
- your Contribution in combination with the Project as it exists at the time you submit the Contribution,

to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution and Project Materials.

If you initiate patent litigation alleging that the Project or a Contribution infringes a patent, then any patent licenses granted by you under this Agreement may terminate as of the date such litigation is filed (to the extent permitted by law).

---

## 5. Moral Rights / Attribution

To the maximum extent permitted by law, you waive and agree not to assert any “moral rights” (including rights of integrity or attribution) that would interfere with the rights granted under this Agreement.

The Maintainer may, but is not required to, credit you for your Contribution.

## 6. Contributor Representations (You Promise That…)

By submitting a Contribution, you represent, warrant, and certify that:

1. **You have the right to contribute.** You have the legal authority to grant the rights in this Agreement.
2. **It’s yours or you’re allowed.** The Contribution is your original work, or you have obtained all necessary rights and permissions to submit it under this Agreement.
3. **No undisclosed copyleft/extra obligations.** To the best of your knowledge, your Contribution does not include material that would require the Project (or any part of it) to be governed by terms that conflict with this Agreement (for example, “copyleft-only” requirements), **unless** you clearly disclose those terms in writing at the time of submission and the Maintainer explicitly accepts the Contribution with that disclosure.
4. **No confidential material.** The Contribution does not include trade secrets or confidential information belonging to any third party.
5. **Employer/contractor clearance.** If your Contribution was created in the scope of employment or under a contract, you have permission from the relevant party (e.g., your employer) to submit it under this Agreement.
6. **No known infringement.** To the best of your knowledge after reasonable inquiry, the Contribution does not knowingly infringe or misappropriate any third-party rights (including copyright, patent, trade secret, or trademark).

## 7. Organization vs. Individual Submissions

### 7.1 Submitting on behalf of an Organization
If you Submit a Contribution as part of your job duties, using Organization resources, under an Organization work order, or otherwise on behalf of an Organization, you represent and warrant that:

- you are authorized to bind the Organization to this Agreement for your Contributions; and
- the Organization accepts responsibility for your Contributions as provided in Sections 8 and 9.

### 7.2 Submitting as an individual (not on behalf of an Organization)
If you Submit a Contribution in your personal capacity (not on behalf of an Organization), you acknowledge and agree that **you personally** accept responsibility for your Contributions as provided in Sections 8 and 9.

---

## 8. Indemnity (Liability for Claims Arising from Your Contribution)

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the responsible party (as determined under Section 7) agrees to **defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the Maintainer and the Project’s owners, affiliates, contributors, and distributors from and against any and all third-party claims, demands, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:

- an allegation that your Contribution (or the Maintainer’s authorized use, modification, distribution, sublicensing, or relicensing of it) infringes, misappropriates, or violates any third-party intellectual property or other rights; or
- a breach of your representations, warranties, or obligations in this Agreement.

**Who is responsible:**
- **If Section 7.1 applies:** the **Organization** is the responsible party and provides the indemnity.
- **If Section 7.2 applies:** **you personally** are the responsible party and provide the indemnity.

**Indemnity procedure:** The Maintainer will provide reasonable notice of any claim and allow the responsible party to control the defense and settlement, provided that no settlement may impose liability or obligations on the Maintainer without the Maintainer’s written consent. The Maintainer may participate with counsel of its own choosing at its own expense.

## 9. Remediation / “Make It Right” Obligation (At Your Cost)

In addition to Section 8, if a claim, demand, legal action, or credible allegation arises that relates to your Contribution (including alleged infringement, misappropriation, or license non-compliance), the responsible party (as determined under Section 7) agrees that, at the Maintainer’s option and direction, it will promptly take commercially reasonable actions to **make the Project Materials legally compliant**, **at the responsible party’s sole cost and expense**, including as applicable:

1. **Replace or rewrite** the Contribution (or affected portions) with non-infringing/non-encumbered code of functionally comparable capability;
2. **Remove** the Contribution (or affected portions) and provide a safe alternative implementation or mitigation plan;
3. **Obtain and pay for** any necessary licenses, permissions, or releases required for lawful use, modification, distribution, sublicensing, and relicensing of the affected Project Materials; and/or
4. **Provide technical assistance** (e.g., engineering time, test coverage updates, migration notes) needed to implement the remediation, without requiring Maintainer or other contributors to bear costs.

This Section does not require the Maintainer to accept any remediation contribution, and the Maintainer may choose any remediation path (including removal) in its sole discretion.

### 9.1 No guarantee of help from others
You acknowledge that the Maintainer and other contributors have **no obligation** to assist you in remediation, rewriting, replacement, licensing negotiations, or legal compliance efforts related to your Contribution. Any assistance that occurs is voluntary and does not reduce the responsible party’s obligations under this Agreement.

### 9.2 No limitation on other rights
The remediation obligations in this Section are **in addition to** (not in place of) the indemnity obligations in Section 8 and any other rights or remedies the Maintainer may have.

## 10. No Conditions

You provide Contributions **“AS IS”**, without conditions of any kind.

---

## 11. General Terms

This Agreement is intended to be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If any provision is unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.

If the Project’s LICENSE file specifies a jurisdiction or venue for legal disputes, that specification applies to this Agreement as well.

---

## 12. Acceptance

**You accept this Agreement** by submitting a Contribution to the Project, including by checking a pull request checkbox that states you agree to the CLA.
